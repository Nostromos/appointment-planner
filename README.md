# Codecademy: Appointment Planner

This is my completed code for the Codecademy Appointment Planner project. It's a small react app that implements basic functionality around contact saving & appointment booking. This will not actually schedule appointments for you on your calendar, but it is a good way to learn about state, props, and react components. 

There's some simple JSX in there too.
